## AI Tool #1

### Tool Name
[e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Perplexity, etc.]

### Version/Model
[e.g., GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Claude 4, GitHub Copilot (GPT-4), etc.]

### Date(s) Used
[e.g., January 15, 2025; January 18, 2025; January 20, 2025]

### Specific Parts of Assignment
[Describe exactly which portions of your work involved AI assistance]
[e.g., Code debugging for functions calculateHash() and validateInput(); Literature review for Section 2.3; Writing assistance for conclusion paragraph; Algorithm optimization for sorting function]

### Prompts Used
[Provide the exact prompts/questions you asked the AI tool]
[e.g., "Help me debug this Python function that calculates SHA-256 hashes"]
[e.g., "Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption"]
[e.g., "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"]

### AI Output/Results
[Describe what the AI tool provided in response]
[e.g., AI provided corrected code with explanations of the logic errors]
[e.g., AI generated a comparison table of encryption methods]
[e.g., AI suggested using input validation and error handling]

### How Output was Verified/Edited
[Explain how you verified accuracy, made modifications, or tested the AI output]
[e.g., Tested the corrected code with sample inputs; Verified encryption explanations against textbook; Implemented suggested security measures and tested functionality]

### Multiple Iterations (if applicable)
[If you used AI tools multiple times, provide a dialogue/conversation summary]
[e.g., First asked for algorithm explanation, then requested code example, finally asked for optimization suggestions]
[e.g., Had 3-turn conversation about debugging process: initial problem → AI suggestion → follow-up clarification]

### Learning & Reflection
[Reflect on what you learned and how the AI assistance contributed to your understanding]
[e.g., I learned about proper error handling techniques and improved my debugging skills]
[e.g., Understanding of cryptographic concepts was enhanced through AI explanations]
