## AI Tool #1

### Tool Name
Claude 

### Version/Model
Claude Sonnet 4.5

### Date(s) Used
10/29/25

### Specific Parts of Assignment
Getting a base setup for the assignment including skeleton code for functions and global variables, debugging, and clarifications on functions

### Prompts Used
given these instructions, and this code, give me psuedo code with explanations for the parser functions 

After implementing the psuedo code this is what I have. How does my code look?

Can you explain the symbol table check and get next token functions?

### AI Output/Results
AI provided me with psuedo code for the assignment and give me a good baseline and explanation for getting started

Helped me understand issues with my code and provided fixes

Helped deepen my understanding of the functions I was implementing and how everything worked

### How Output was Verified/Edited
I implemented the psuedo code and checked with Claude afterwards to see where I made errors and also tested myself to see which functions needed work

Utilized provided fixes and made sure functions worked accordingly during testing

Couldn't verify the last prompt as it was more of an explanation than code but helped me better understand the project

### Multiple Iterations (if applicable)
Prompted Claude to explain the psuedo code more in depth and give me some code to make sure I was getting the right ideas and properly executing psuedo code


### Learning & Reflection
I learned more about prompting AI and getting the results/answers I require, I also learned more about debugging and testing code as well as the coding process as a whole
